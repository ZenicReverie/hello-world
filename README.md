===========

Studied programming in college, but fell out of practice. I'm not sure where to start getting back into it. This seems like a nice place to start. I'm interested in game programming mainly. I'm most familiar with C++ and Python, although Unity has caught my attention as of late. Just need to put the time into relearning to code, and create my own projects.
